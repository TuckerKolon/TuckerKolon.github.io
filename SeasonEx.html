<P>		Hello everyone! I’m Tucker and this is the first of many entries into The Celtic 
and I wanted to start off by giving my exceptions of this season  with the roster, record, and how far we could go. 

<P>		Well this summer was a pretty bland summer compared to last’s year complete roster overhaul 
of signing <b>Gordon Hayward</b> and the crazy trade that sent us <b>Kyrie Irving</b>, but sent away fan favorite 
<b>Isaiah Thomas</b>. We didn’t lose anyone important this summer, but we were able to retain 6th man, 
<b>Marcus Smart</b>, with a 4 year $52 million dollar contract. This may seem like overkill for a guy who only 
averaged 10 PPG off of 36.7% FG last season, but if you watch the film, Smart’s impact is shown with his 
stout defensive presence and his ability to generate plays in key moments (Watch the 4th quarter of the 
home game against Houston as a example).A notable signing this summer was  Euroleague star, 
<b>Brad Wanamaker</b>, watching a little film from his time with the Turkish team Fenerbache Brad  could earn 
himself serious minutes off the bench with his defensive prowess and versatilely on and off the ball. 
Finally in the draft, with the 27th overall pick we draft A&M Center <b>Robert Williams</b>. Honestly I was a 
little surprised he fell so much in the draft. This guy last year was projected to be a top-10 pick but 
decided to play out one more year just to see his stock fall. He does have concerning problems with 
work ethic (Seriously how do you miss your flight and lose your wallet?) and health issues, but Williams 
has all the tools become a great NBA player and I can’t wait to watch his development  and hopefully
he could be the crowned replace once <b> Al Horford</b> sadly leaves Boston or retires.
<P>Now we got this summer out of the way we can finally get to the juicy stuff. This season. With 
the return of both Hayward and Irving off of season-ending injuries we can finally see what this 
revamped Celtics roster is made of. There is one thing in particular this season especially at the 
beginning that I will be watching very closely; How Hayward fits into the roster. Hayward missed all of last 
season (Besides the first 5 minutes) with a broken ankle and his addition will come as a great relief and 
concern. There is no denying Hayward’s skill with his efficient 3-point and midrange game there is a 
reason that Ainge went all in on the former Utah forward with 4 year $128 million dollar contract. But 
he needs time to adjust back to game speed, he has been out for a full year and he will need to build 
back his stamina and strength to a NBA level. So I don’t expect to see Hayward at 100% until mid-season 
and he and I could even see Stevens have Hayward off the bench for the first few games. This team 
really had a ton of unexpected success last year with the rise of players like <b>Jayson Tatum</b>, <b>Jaylen 
Brown</b>, and <b>Terry Rozier</b>. Some of these guys will have to adjust with Hayward taking away minutes 
especially with Rozier. Rozier is coming into the final season of his rookie contract and he wants to be a 
starter which means paying the man starter money.Unless Irving bolts for New York (Which I don’t 
expect, letting Rozier walk) Rozier will take the majority of the burden in a reduced role this season. Should be no 
 worries with Kyrie being inserted back in because the fact he played with this roster for majority of games until March. 
The man should also be balling out right because the surgery was only to remove screws from a previous one. 
<p>Now who will be starting night from night is surprising very hard to predict at this moment with Hayward’s acclamation.  
My Prediction by mid-season as follows: PG: Irving C: Horford SG: Brown PF Tatum SF: Hayward. Now I 
could definitely see us starting the big man from down under, <b>Aaron Baynes</b>, at the 4 against bigger 
match-ups like the Pelicans or the 76ers and seeing Hayward off the bench. We had tons of success with 
the lineup including Baynes in the playoffs with his defensive domination of big men like Embiid and 
just having him off the bench every night seems like a waste of good talent. The Celtics have a very 
uncommon occurrence in the NBA (Unless you’re the warriors Ugh.) we are stacked at basically every 
position and some may say too stacked, but I have trust that Stevens will figure out the best starting 
lineup for this roster.
<P>Now with my record prediction for the 2018-2019 season: 58-24. I think we can carry over our 
success from last season and win the #1 seed in the East with the fall of Toronto who has even larger 
chemistry issues to figure out. With the continued development of our young guys like Tatum (who will 
make the all-star team this season don’t @ me) and Brown. This team is just head and shoulders better 
than almost every team in the East besides the Raptors and 76ers. I won’t give my playoff predictions 
until mid-season as I want to watch how this year unfolds (hint hint we are going to the finals). This 
team is probably be the most exciting team to watch this season and for the first time since 2010 we 
have a chance to get back to the finals and hang up banner 18. I expect great things and hopefully I’m 
not disappointed. Until next time.
